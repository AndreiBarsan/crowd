# TODO (in addition to official project milestones and in-code TODOs)
 * Set up automatic PEP 8 formatting and linting, even inside notebooks.
 * Have documentation-specific sweep over all code, ensuring that especially
   non-trivial stuff is explained right.
 * Remove all absolute file locations from code (no more '~/data').
 * Set up script(s) to download the downloadable data, and format/merge it
   accordingly.
 * Ensure you have up-to-date instructions on obtaining the non-downloadable
   data.
 * Recreate all results on a fresh machine (after everything is done).
 * Add reference to Martin's paper!!! Giving credit is very important.
